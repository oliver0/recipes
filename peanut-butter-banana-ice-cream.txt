Ingredients:

- 2 frozen bananas
- 2 Tablespoons organic natural peanut butter
- water, if needed to facilitate blending

Directions:

1. Break the frozen bananas into chunks and toss them into a mini food 
processor, along with the peanut butter. (I also like to add a pinch 
of Himalayan sea salt if using unsalted peanut butter.)
2. Blend until the bananas break down into a soft-serve consistency, 
adding a tablespoon or two of water to help facilitate blending, if 
necessary.
